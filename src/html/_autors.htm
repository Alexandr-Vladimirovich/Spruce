                <p class="top-text__text">Food happens to us—every single day. It bumps up against everything else we care about: family, health, budget, schedule…and our happiness.</p>
                <p class="top-text__text">Fellow cooks, we see you because we’re not just food editors, we are you. Sure, we’ve worked in publishing, restaurant kitchens, TV studios, grocery stores, and meal kit companies. But we’re also parents, dog-walkers, commuters, shoppers, homeowners—people who love food as much as we need it, just like you.</p>
                <p class="top-text__text">We are that reliable friend who cooks with you by your side, showing you exactly how a recipe plays out, step by step. We’re answering your questions. We’re here when you need a soft boiled egg, when you’re perfecting pilau, when you’re on a budget and throwing a party anyways, when you’re 11 and you need a snack, when you’ve just moved in with vegans, when someone gives you an Instant Pot, and when you’re pledging to eat less of this and more of that. We want you to be the first one invited to the potluck.</p>
                <p class="top-text__text">Listen, we’ve been at this for a while. The Spruce Eats evolved from a 25-year archive of recipes generated by chefs, teachers, cookbook writers, home cooks, food makers, and more. And all that content? It’s alive. We’re constantly updating and testing it. And, we’re constantly adding to it. We have well over 10,000 recipes. But right now you only need one. One that works. The one you’re looking for—maybe the one you didn’t even know you wanted.</p>
                <p class="top-text__text">The Spruce Eats is here to meet cooks wherever you are, and to show you the way.</p>
